<div class="note-editable" contenteditable="true" role="textbox" aria-multiline="true"><h3>Here is how to use our writing service</h3><p>Our ordering process is easy, and you can buy an internal assessment within a few minutes. However, there are some insights we would like to share with you before getting started. As an IB writing service provider with experience working with students from around the world, including Qatar, Turkey, India, the United Kingdom, and other countries, we’ve noticed that some prefer to simply share the rubric, while others pay more attention to details. That’s why we’ve designed a professional online order form to meet the expectations of all our clients.</p><h4>1. Complete the order form</h4><p>The most important step is providing us with the initial information. Be clear, choose the right data, and give us insights and detailed instructions.</p><p><b>Level of writing</b>: For <b>SL</b>, we recommend choosing the '<u>high school</u>' level. For <b>HL</b>, it’s better to select the '<u>IB student</u>' level.</p><p><b>Choose a discipline</b>: There are multiple IB disciplines, ranging from the most complex to less challenging. We can work on most of them, including: Math, SEHS, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, ESS, Business, Computer Science, Economics, Global Politics, History, English, Digital Society, Psychology, World Studies, Design Technology. For the ToK essays, there are areas of knowledge (AoK) and ways of knowledge (WoK) we can work on them all.</p><p><b>Write instructions</b>: The instructions section is designed to establish communication with your IB writer and provide them with a starting point. You can specify whether you want them to write an extended essay from scratch or edit an existing one based on your tutor’s feedback. Share general recommendations, suggest a research topic of interest, and include your own suggestions. You can also share your personal reading list beyond the classroom syllabus to help the writer better connect with your ideas and personality.</p><p><b>Deadline selection</b>: When you want to buy an IB IA, you can choose your preferred deadline when ordering online. Our company offers the flexibility to select a deadline that suits you, ranging from urgent orders starting at 5 hours to longer deadlines up to 30 days.</p><p><b>Citation style</b>: To avoid any plagiarism issues and ensure your IB assessment is properly formatted, you can select the required citation style. Our IB writers are familiar with all major academic formats, including APA, MLA, In-text citation, Footnotes, Harvard, and others.</p><p><b>Number of words</b>: Each type of IB assessment (EE, IA, TOK) has its own set of criteria, so it’s crucial to review the rubrics provided by your teachers and ensure the required word count for each essay. When you want to buy <i>extended essay</i>, be sure to pay for 15 pages, which equals 4,000 words. </p><p>For an <i>internal assessment</i>, the minimum number of pages is 12, as it often requires additional components such as calculations, graphs, and images. Our IB writer will ensure the word count meets the required 2,200 words. </p><p>For the <i>TOK essay</i> writing service, we recommend paying for 6 pages, which is approximately 1,600 words.</p><h4>2.

This could be an IB alumnus, an IB tutor, or a freelance academic writer familiar with the IB curriculum who has written many high-scoring assessments in the past. We prioritize confidentiality and recommend not sharing your real name, email, WhatsApp, or other personal data. Our company ensures that the assigned writer is an expert in your specific discipline, ready to meet your deadline—even if it’s urgent—and available 24/7 to answer your questions, share drafts, or discuss research topics.
